# My Flask Web App with Firebase Authentication

Welcome to our **Flask Web App**! This project is a simple, yet stylish website that allows users to **sign up** and **log in** securely using **Firebase Authentication**.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project is built using:
- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework in Python, which helps us build and run the website.
- **Firebase Authentication**: A secure way to handle user login and signup, ensuring that personal information is safely managed.
- **HTML & CSS**: The foundation of our website’s layout and design.

This app has three main pages:
1. **Home**: A welcoming page where users can navigate to log in or sign up.
2. **Login**: A page for users to enter their credentials and log in.
3. **Signup**: A page for new users to create an account.

Each page has been styled to give a professional, modern look. Below, we’ll walk through how you can set up and run this project on your computer.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Set Up Python and Flask

Before running the app, you’ll need **Python** installed on your computer. If you don’t have it already, you can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

To install the required libraries, open a terminal (or command prompt) and run:
```bash
pip install Flask firebase-admin
```

### 2. Create a Firebase Project

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
2. Navigate to **Authentication** > **Sign-in Method**, then enable **Email/Password** sign-in.
3. Go to **Project Settings** and under **Service accounts**, generate a new private key. This will download a JSON file that you’ll need to place in the project directory.

### 3. Organize Your Project Files

Make sure you have the following file structure:

```
my_flask_app/
├── app.py               # Main application file
├── firebase_key.json    # Firebase private key JSON file
├── templates/           # HTML files for each page
│   ├── home.html
│   ├── login.html
│   └── signup.html
└── static/              # Custom styling (CSS) file
    └── styles.css
```

### 4. Run the App

Once everything is set up, run this command in your terminal:

```bash
python app.py
```

This will start the website, and you’ll see a message that it’s running at an address like `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. Open this address in your web browser to see the website!

## 🤔 How It Works

1. **Home Page**  
   The Home page is the main entry point of the website, where users can choose to log in or sign up.

2. **Login Page**  
   If a user already has an account, they can log in by entering their email and password. Once logged in, they can access additional features or content on the site.

3. **Signup Page**  
   New users can create an account by providing an email and password, which are securely stored using Firebase.
